    <string name="translation_guidlines"><![CDATA[<h1>Translation Guidelines</h1>
<p>
      <strong>Accurate</strong> - Accurate translations effectively communicate the intended meaning of the original, divinely inspired text. An accurate translation expresses the meaning the author intended for the original audience in the original context.
      <p>
        1. To the extent that is possible, nothing is added, misconstrued, or deleted from the original message.
        <br/>2. It does not recast the meaning of the original text to make it more relevant to the contemporary audience.
        <br/>3. An accurate translation does not distort the meaning in order to favor a specific interpretive perspective. It should be free from theological, cultural, or personal biases.
        <br/>4. An accurate translation communicates historical events and facts accurately.
      <p>
</p>
<p>
      <strong>Clear</strong> - Clear translations will use whatever language structures are needed to help readers easily read and understand it.
      <p>
        1. A clear translation may use as many or as few terms as necessary to communicate the original meaning as clearly as possible.
        <br/>2. Making a clear translation does not mean that the translator clarifies something that is ambiguous in the source text.
        <br/>3. Making a clear translation does not mean that the translator gives the reader a specific interpretation for every passage where meaning is genuinely debated.
      </p>
</p>
<p>
      <strong>Natural</strong> - Natural translations use language forms that are reflect the way the target language is used in corresponding contexts.
      <p>
        1. Natural Bible translations sound like they were produced by an adult native speaker who speaks and/or writes well.
        <br/>2. A natural Bible translation does not use expressions that are particular to their own culture in order to make the translation appear natural.
        <br/>3. It is more important for a portion of Scripture to be translated accurately than for it to sound perfectly natural to everyone who reads it.
      </p>
</p>
<p> We believe that a translation has the highest likelihood of being good quality when after applying the guidelines above, the following are completed: </p>
<p>
    1. It is tested and approved by believers of the language community and their church leaders.
    <br/>2. Ongoing revisions and improvements are made.

    <string name="statement_of_faith"><![CDATA[<h1>Statement of Faith</h1>
<p>We believe:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Bible is divinely inspired by God and has final authority.</li>
    <li>God is one and exists in three persons: God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit.</li>
    <li>Because of the fall of man, all humans are sinful, and in need of salvation.</li>
    <li>The death of Christ is a substitute for sinners and provides for the cleansing of those who believe.</li>
    <li>By God’s grace, through faith, man receives salvation as a free gift because of Jesus’ death and resurrection.</li>
    <li>The resurrection of all—the saved to eternal life and the lost to eternal punishment.</li>
</ul>]]></string>
